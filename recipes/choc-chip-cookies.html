            <p>You can never go wrong with chocolate chip cookies. 
        A classic, and my personal favorite, a batch of these 
        warm, soft cookies fresh from the oven with melty, semisweet 
        chocolaty goodness is hard to resist. They’re always popular,
        and once they’re ready they don’t last long, 
        so be sure to set aside a few for yourself before they disappear!
             </p>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow butter to soften by setting it on the counter for about 30-60 minutes before you begin.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F</li>
            <br>
            <li>To keep the bottoms of the cookies from getting scorched or 
        sticking to the pans, and for easier cleanup, I line the baking 
        sheets with parchment paper. If you don’t have parchment paper, 
        you can use butter, shortening, or cooking spray to coat the pan 
        so the cookies don’t stick.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 cup butter (softened)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>12 oz semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to cream together the butter, sugar, and brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Add baking soda, salt, eggs, vanilla, and half of the flour. Mix on medium-high speed for about one minute until combined.</li>
            <li>Mix in the rest of the flour.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>On lined baking sheet, drop dough in rounded tablespoons about two inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. The edges will be slightly darker, and the centers will be soft.</li>
            <li>Move cookies from the baking sheet to a cooling rack.</li>
        </ol>   
    <p>Makes about 48 cookies.</p>
