        <p>Looking for a way to add some cozy, wintery flavor to the cookie jar? Creamy white chocolate in a soft, 
            buttery cookie dressed up for the holidays with a touch of peppermint crunch is the perfect choice. 
            Delicious on their own, or served with a mug of rich hot cocoa, these cookies are sure to be a favorite 
            of the season!

            I use Andes Peppermint Crunch Baking Chips for this recipe because they have a nice creamy texture to go with their bits of
            crunchy peppermint. If you can't find these chips, or if you prefer to have more of the crunchy candy texture in your cookies, 
            you can crush up peppermint candy canes to use in place of the chips.

    <h2>Preparation</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Remove butter from the fridge about 30 minutes to 1 hour before beginning so that it has time to soften.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Use parchment paper to line the baking sheets so that the cookies don’t stick to the pan. This also helps prevent 
                burning the bottoms of the cookies, and makes for easier cleanup. If you don’t have parchment paper, use shortening 
                or butter to grease the pan.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°</li>
        </ul>
