            <p>Peanut Butter & Chocolate: one of the most irresistible flavor combinations 
    in the world. It’s a match made in dessert heaven. And since cookies 
    are my all-time favorite treat, these ones always hit the spot with their salty-sweet 
    morsels of peanut butter next to creamy milk chocolate. If you’re a fan of peanut butter 
    and chocolate, these cookies are for you.

         <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>About 30 minutes to an hour before you begin, set butter on the counter so it has enough time to soften.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F</li>
                <br>
                 <li>For this recipe, the baking sheets do not need to be greased, but for more evenly baked cookies and simpler cleanup, line 
        the baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            </ul>
          <h2> Ingredients </h2>
                <ul>
